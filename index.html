<h2>Hello and welcome to my English learning website!</h2>

It does not matter if you are young or old, a student or a senior citizen, a housewife or an established professional, miserable at languages or a polyglot.
<br>
All that does matter is your love for languages and a healthy dose of curiosity. I am certain you have them both, or you would not be reading this :) 
<p>
  <i>"To learn a language is to have one more window from which to look at the world."</i> â€“ Chinese proverb.

On this site you can find information about my previous experience as a tutor, information about the courses, and the price list.

<h3>About me</h3>
My name is Mareta and I am a student at <a href="http://www.ttu.ee">Tallinn University of Technology.</a> Having lived in the UK for 3 years I now enjoy teaching English to both school students and adults. I have organised English language conversation
  <p>
    sessions for adult learners at Tallinn Central Library for the past two years, as well as taught students of various ages on a one-on-one basis. 
<h3>Courses</h3>
Private lessons are organised in Tallinn for all age groups and levels. If you are interested in improving your spoken and written English, or you think that your reading, listening or grammar could be a tiny bit better, you have come to the right place!
