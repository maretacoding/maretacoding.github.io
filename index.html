<h2>Hello and welcome to my English learning website!</h2>

It does not matter if you are young or old, a student or a senior citizen, a housewife or a lawyer, short or tall, 
<br>
happy or miserable. All that does matter is your love for languages and a healthy dose of curiosity. I am certain you
<br>
have them both, or you would not be reading this :) 
<p>
  <i>To learn a language is to have one more window from which to look at the world.</i> â€“Chinese proverb.
<p>
Perhaps I can accompany you on this interesting journey of learning English. 
<p>
On this site you can find information about my previous experience as a tutor, feedback from students, preliminary info about the organisational side, and the price list.
