<h2>Hello and welcome to my English learning website!</h2>

It does not matter if you are young or old, a student or a senior citizen, a housewife or an established professional, miserable at languages or a polyglot.
<br>
All that does matter is your love for languages and a healthy dose of curiosity. I am certain you have them both, or you would not be reading this :) 
<p>
Do you agree with the following Chinese proverb? <i>"To learn a language is to have one more window from which to look at the world."</i> So do I!
<p>
Scroll down to read about my previous experience as an English tutor, familiarise yourself with the possibilities of becoming a fluent English speaker, <p> and get a feel for the price list.

<h3>About me</h3>
My name is Mareta and I am a student at <a href="http://www.ttu.ee">Tallinn University of Technology.</a> Having lived in the United Kingdom for 3 years I now enjoy teaching 
<br> English to both youngsters and adults. I have organised English language conversation sessions for adult learners at Tallinn Central Library for the past two years, 
  <br> as well as taught students of various ages on a one-on-one basis. 
<h3>Courses</h3>
Private lessons are organised in Tallinn for all age groups and levels. If you are interested in improving your spoken and written English, or you would like to become better 
<br> at reading, listening and grammar, you have come to the right place!
